# Dependencies

This project relies on several key Python libraries to function. Here is a list of the main dependencies and their roles:

- **beautifulsoup4:** Used for web scraping to extract song data from Vocaloard.
- **fastapi:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **pydantic:** Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. Pydantic enforces type hints at runtime, and provides user-friendly errors when data is invalid.
- **Requests:** A simple, yet elegant, HTTP library for Python, used for making HTTP requests to external APIs (like VocaDB).
- **SQLAlchemy:** The Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
- **uvicorn:** A lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, used to run the FastAPI application.
- **jinja2:** A modern and designer-friendly templating engine for Python, used to render the HTML pages.
- **python-multipart:** A streaming multipart parser for Python, used by FastAPI to handle file uploads.
