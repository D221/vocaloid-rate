# APIs Used

This project integrates with several external APIs to provide its features.

- **[Vocaloard](https://vocaloard.injpok.tokyo/en/):** The primary source of song data. The application scrapes the Top 300 rankings directly from this site.

- **[VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/):** Used to fetch lyrics for the songs. The application makes API calls to VocaDB to retrieve lyrics based on the song title and artist.

- **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/):** Used for the embedded video player. The application embeds the YouTube player to stream the music videos for the songs.
